# Crop_Classification_Tulare
This is a fairly large project, the objective of the project was to classify the crops grown in the fields of Tulare county in Southern California. This required the use of both satellite imagery and shapefiles containing cropland boundaries. The geographical data alignment was created using QGIS. We then used 5 spectral indices along with Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi Layer perceptrons in order to predict which crops were growing in which fields. There are four different fikes, the CNN file contain the code for the CNN along with a confusion matrix, the MLP file is similar, the data file contains the data used with information and the statistic file contains the statistics about the data.
